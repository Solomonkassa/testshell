.SH NAME
.B our own simple_shell
- We try to build our own simple shell.
.SH SYNOPSIS
It is the creation of a simple unix command interpreter that provides a user interface to access operating system services.
.SH
.SH
.SH DESCRIPTION
we use the following files to build our own simple shell:
.PP
-1.0.getppid.c (Write a program that prints the PID of the parent process.
.PP -1.1._proc_sys_kernel_pid_max - Write a shell script that prints the maximum value a process ID can be.
.PP-2.0.av.c - (Write a program that prints all the arguments, without using ac.)
.PP-2.1.Read_Line.c - (getline) Write a program that prints "$ ", wait for the user to enter a command, prints it on the next line.
.PP-2.2.command_line_to_av.c - (strtok) Write a function that splits a string and returns an array of each word of the string.
.PP-3.execve.c - Executing a program. The system call execve allows a process to execute another program (man 2 execve).
.PP-4.fork.c - The system call fork (man 2 fork) creates a new child process, almost identical to the parent (the process that calls fork).
.PP-4.1.fork.c - Using the return value of fork, it is possible to know if the current process is the father or the child: fork will return 0 to the child, and the PID of the child to the father.
.PP-5.wait.c - The wait system call (man 2 wait) suspends execution of the calling process until one of its children terminates.
.PP-6.fork+wait+execve.c - Exercise: fork + wait + execve Write a program that executes the command ls -l /tmp in 5 different child processes.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.SHOur Shell must return the execution in standard output of the command typed by the user
If the command doesn't exist, say "Doesn't exist".
.SH EXAMPLES TEST
we compare with printf function original our own _printf function with next examples:
